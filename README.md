 **My SyMenu tools** project (*ms_symtools*) was born to provide **SyMenu** with a series of advanced features, to facilitate the maintenance of complex menus. Of course portables.

>  *[**SyMenu**](https://www.ugmfree.it "SyMenu Home") is an advanced portable alternative to* Windows 'Start Menu'. *Extremely flexible and easily    customizable, it allows you to create multiple dedicated menus (e.g. MMedia, CAD, etc.) with all programs, documents, and workspaces relating to a single  area, well organized and specialized according to the interests and needs of the user.*

*Of course, the **ms_symtool** tools have been created based on my needs and are often not quite 'user-friendly', but I think they can also be useful for other experienced users with similar problems. For this, they are Open Source and the latest version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools "Public repository").*

--------------------------------------
 **PrettyPrint**
>  Gets a snapshot from the file SyMenuItem.zip, with all the data of the nodes currently present in the SyMenu menu and presents them, in the form of a complete tree, in a dynamic HTML page. Fragments can be cut and inserted in custom pages.

 **MD exchange**
> This tool exports and imports the SyMenu structure to/from markdown files. This allows for easily management of large menus: by editing the MD file you can update and reorganize the menu tree, change names and edit descriptions for all items.

--------------------------------------
**Installation** (same for all ms-symtools)

 - Unzip the distribution file in dir <code>[SyMenu]\Programfile</code>, so you get: <code>[SyMenu]\Programfile\sm-symtools\xxx.xxx</code>
 - Look at the help file <code>tool-name.chm</code> for specific preconditions,  instructions, etc., starting from the main file, e.g. prettyPrintItems.bat.
