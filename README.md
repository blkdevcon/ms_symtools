# ms_symtools
This project was born with the aim of providing [SyMenu](https://www.ugmfree.it) with a series of new features, to facilitate the maintenance of complex menus.

**SyMenu** is an advanced portable alternative for *Windows 'Start Menu'.* Extremely flexible and easy to customize, it allows you to create multiple 'dedicated' menus (e.g. MMedia, CAD, etc.) with all related programs, documents and workspaces to one area, well ordered and specialized according to the interest and needs of the user. 

Of course the **ms_symtool** tools were created based on my needs and are often not really 'user-friendly', but I think they can also be useful to other experienced users with similar needs. For this they are Open Source and the latest version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools "Public repository").

## Tools
  1. **PrettyPrintItems** (work in progress)  is a tool that extracts from <code>SyMenuItem.zip</code> a snapshoot, with all the data of the nodes present in the **SyMenu** menu and presents them, in the form of a complete tree, in a dynamic HTML page.
