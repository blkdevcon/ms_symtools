The **ms_symtool** project was born with the aim of providing **SyMenu** with a series of advanced features, to facilitate the maintenance of complex menus. Of course portables.

>  *[**SyMenu**](https://www.ugmfree.it "SyMenu Home") is an advanced portable    alternative to* Windows 'Start Menu'. *Extremely flexible and easy    customizable, it allows you to create multiple dedicated menus (e.g. MMedia,    CAD, etc.) with all programs, documents and workspaces relating to a single    area, well organized and specialized according to the interests and needs of the user.*

*Of course the **ms_symtool** tools have been created based on my needs and are often not quite 'user-friendly', but I think they can also be useful for other experienced users with similar problems. For this they are Open Source and the latest version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools "Public repository").*
