The **ms_symtool** project was born with the aim of providing **SyMenu** with a series of advanced features, to facilitate the maintenance of complex menus. Of course portables.

>  *[**SyMenu**](https://www.ugmfree.it "SyMenu Home") is an advanced portable    alternative to* Windows 'Start Menu'. *Extremely flexible and easy    customizable, it allows you to create multiple dedicated menus (e.g. MMedia,    CAD, etc.) with all programs, documents and workspaces relating to a single    area, well organized and specialized according to the interests and needs of the user.*

*Of course the **ms_symtool** tools have been created based on my needs and are often not quite 'user-friendly', but I think they can also be useful for other experienced users with similar problems. For this they are Open Source and the latest version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools "Public repository").*

[**PrettyPrint Items**](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools/tree/main/PrettyPrintItems  "Download from GitHub") is a tool that extracts a snapshot from the file <code> SyMenuItem.zip</code>, with all the data of the nodes currently present in the **SyMenu** menu and presents them, in the form of a complete tree, in a dynamic HTML page. This allows you to easily handle menus of any size and complexity.

The **PrettyPrintItems** tool is already useful, as is, for documenting menus, but it is also a good starting point for further tools (under development).

**Installation** (same for all ms-symtools)

 - Unzip the distribution file in dir <code>xxx\SyMenu\Programfile</code>, so you get: <code>xxxx\SyMenu\Programfile\sm-symtools\xxx.xxx</code>
 - Look at the help file <code>tool-name.chm</code> for specific preconditions,  istructions, etc..
