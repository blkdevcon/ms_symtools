**My SyMenu tools**  project (*ms_symtool*) was born with to provide **SyMenu** with a series of advanced features, to facilitate the maintenance of complex menus. Of course portables.

>  *[**SyMenu**](https://www.ugmfree.it "SyMenu Home") is an advanced portable alternative to* Windows 'Start Menu'. *Extremely flexible and easy    customizable, it allows you to create multiple dedicated menus (e.g. MMedia, CAD, etc.) with all programs, documents and workspaces relating to a single  area, well organized and specialized according to the interests and needs of the user.*

*Of course, the **ms_symtool** tools have been created based on my needs and are often not quite 'user-friendly', but I think they can also be useful for other experienced users with similar problems. For this, they are Open Source and the latest version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools "Public repository").*

-------------------------------
*Available Tools:*

[**SyMenu prettyPrint**](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools/blob/main/SyMenu.prettyPrint.2.2.zip?raw=true  "Download from GitHub") (<tt>prettyPrintItems.bat</tt>) is a tool that extracts a snapshot from the file <code>SyMenuItem.zip</code>, with all the data of the nodes currently present in the **SyMenu** menu and presents them, in the form of a complete tree, in a dynamic HTML page. This allows you to easily handle menus of any size and complexity. 

[**SyMenu MD Exchange**](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools/blob/main/MDExchange2.1.zip?raw=true  "Download from GitHub") (<tt>SyMenu2MDexport.bat</tt> and <tt>MD2SyMenuImport.bat</tt>) is a tool that allows you to share menus between users, adding import/export functionality to SyMenu.

The export format is *markdown*. This allows for easily handling also of large menus. By editing an *MD* file you can update and reorganize the menu tree, change names and edit tooltips for all items. 

[**SyMenu Undo**](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools/blob/main/MDExchange2.1.zip?raw=true  "Download from GitHub")  (<tt>SyMenuUndo.bat</tt>) is included in **MDexchange**. This simple tool restores SyMenuItem.zip from the most recent backup.

[**SyMenu to dir**](https://github.com/msillano/ms_symtools/blob/main/SyMenu.toDir.2.1.zip?raw=true "Download from GitHub") Creates a folder structure in the file system that is isomorphic to the SyMenu's tree.
